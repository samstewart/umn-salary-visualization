A simple visualization of the publicly available salary data from the University of Minnesota. My goal is to highlight the absurd income disparity between the highest and lowest paid at the university.

Notes on the data processing:
The raw data was pulled from UMN's human resource page 

We filter out anyone who makes below $10,000 per year because they tend to be temporary workers and thus uninteresting. The only danger is that we also ignore those adjuncts who are teaching only a few courses.
